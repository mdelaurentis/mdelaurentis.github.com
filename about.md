title: About
---

I live in West Philadelphia with my wife Kate and Beagle Lucy.  I am a
software developer at the University of Pennsylvania, working on
applications that support genomic research.  I'm working on a master's
in Computer Science at Drexel University.  I also play guitar, cook,
brew beer, and fix up my crazy old Victorian house.
